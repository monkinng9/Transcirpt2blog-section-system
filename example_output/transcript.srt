what we're sort of interested in at the
 

21
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,230
what we're sort of interested in at the
moment is llm apps and I don't know what

00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:27,240
moment is llm apps and I don't know what
 

23

3 Etc as we're going through this I

42
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:56,680
3 Etc as we're going through this I
 

43
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,270
3 Etc as we're going through this I
think there are some key themes though

44
00:00:58,270 --> 00:00:58,280
think there are some key themes though
 

45
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,790
think there are some key themes though
that we can take away for developing

46
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:00,800
that we can take away for developing
 

47
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,670
that we can take away for developing
these apps and for me personally the two

48
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:03,680
these apps and for me personally the two
 

49
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,870
these apps and for me personally the two
big interests that I've got here around

50
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:05,880
big interests that I've got here around
 

51
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,950
big interests that I've got here around
llm apps are around personalization and

52
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:08,960
llm apps are around personalization and
 

53
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,550
llm apps are around personalization and
curation so I see these as being two of

54
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:12,560
curation so I see these as being two of
 

55
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,190
curation so I see these as being two of
a number of things that are really

56
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:14,200
a number of things that are really
 

57
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,510
a number of things that are really
changing to allow people to take use of

58
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:16,520
changing to allow people to take use of
 

59
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,830
changing to allow people to take use of
this kind of Technology more and more so

60
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:18,840
this kind of Technology more and more so
 

61
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,030
this kind of Technology more and more so
when I'm talking about

62
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:20,040
when I'm talking about
 

63
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,109
when I'm talking about
personalization again here I'm talking

64
00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:22,119
personalization again here I'm talking
 

65
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:24,350
personalization again here I'm talking
about like the idea of how to make

66
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:24,360
about like the idea of how to make
 

67
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,590
about like the idea of how to make
things the way you like them and LS open

00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:29,640
up a whole world for this we've got the
 

71
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,109
up a whole world for this we've got the
ability ility to do personalized

interactions we can do personalized
 

75
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,590
interactions we can do personalized
results so that every user gets a

00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:36,600
results so that every user gets a
 

77
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,350

different set of results and stuff like
 

79
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,630
different set of results and stuff like
that an example of the personalized sort

00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:40,640
that an example of the personalized sort
 

81
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,109
that an example of the personalized sort
of interactions can be things like

personalized levels so when someone's

84
00:01:44,389 --> 00:01:44,399
personalized levels so when someone's
 

85
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,590
personalized levels so when someone's
learning something rather than just have

86
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:46,600
learning something rather than just have
 

87
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,230
learning something rather than just have
level one level two level three you can

88
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:49,240
level one level two level three you can
 

89
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,950
level one level two level three you can
actually make it so it can work out

90
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:50,960
actually make it so it can work out
 

91
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,990
actually make it so it can work out
where the person's at and teach to that

92
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:54,000
where the person's at and teach to that
 

93
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,069
where the person's at and teach to that
and support them at the level that

94
00:01:56,069 --> 00:01:56,079
and support them at the level that
 

95
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,630
and support them at the level that
they're at and grow their skills with

96
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:58,640
they're at and grow their skills with
 

97
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,510
they're at and grow their skills with
this kind of thing so this idea of

98
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:00,520
this kind of thing so this idea of
 

99
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,990
this kind of thing so this idea of
personalization I see as being a huge

100
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:03,000
personalization I see as being a huge
 

101
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,590
personalization I see as being a huge
factor in building llm apps nowadays the

102
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:06,600
factor in building llm apps nowadays the
 

103
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,150
factor in building llm apps nowadays the
second area that I think is really

104
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:08,160
second area that I think is really
 

105
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,350
second area that I think is really
interesting is the whole idea of

106
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:10,360
interesting is the whole idea of
 

107
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,790
interesting is the whole idea of
curation I think it's pretty obvious to

108
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:12,800
curation I think it's pretty obvious to
 

109
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,150
curation I think it's pretty obvious to
most people that we're all well beyond

110
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:15,160
most people that we're all well beyond
 

111
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,830
most people that we're all well beyond
data overload nowadays there's just so

112
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:17,840
data overload nowadays there's just so
 

113
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,670
data overload nowadays there's just so
much data out there that there's no way

114
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:20,680
much data out there that there's no way
 

115
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,390
much data out there that there's no way
we can keep up with watching you know

116
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:22,400
we can keep up with watching you know
 

117
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,270
we can keep up with watching you know
all the the YouTube videos with reading

llm apps can be like a filter on the

124
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:32,360
llm apps can be like a filter on the
 

125
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,990
llm apps can be like a filter on the
world for us that they can go out look

126
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:35,000
world for us that they can go out look
 

127
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,710
world for us that they can go out look
at source material bring stuff back use

128
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:37,720
at source material bring stuff back use
 

129
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,430
at source material bring stuff back use
that the whole idea here is that we

130
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:40,440
that the whole idea here is that we
 

131
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,750
that the whole idea here is that we
really want to get what we need when we

132
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:42,760
really want to get what we need when we
 

133
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,110
really want to get what we need when we
need it and try to filter out a lot of

134
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:45,120
need it and try to filter out a lot of
 

135
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,509
need it and try to filter out a lot of
the other stuff that's going on here and

the other stuff that's going on here and
 

137
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,030
the other stuff that's going on here and
this brings me to a recent app that I

138
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:49,040
this brings me to a recent app that I
 

139
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,710
this brings me to a recent app that I
built that I really wanted something

140
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:50,720
built that I really wanted something
 

141
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,630
built that I really wanted something
that did really good high quality notes

142
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:53,640
that did really good high quality notes
 

143

I've added into this over time as you go

148
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:01,920
I've added into this over time as you go
 

149
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,710
I've added into this over time as you go
through now one of the challenges for

150
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:03,720
through now one of the challenges for
 

151
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,509
through now one of the challenges for
most sort of summarization and stuff

152
00:03:05,509 --> 00:03:05,519
most sort of summarization and stuff
 

153
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,910
most sort of summarization and stuff
like that is you end up with very short

154
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:07,920
like that is you end up with very short
 

155
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,390
like that is you end up with very short
summaries of videos and actually what

156
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:10,400
summaries of videos and actually what
 

157
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,430
summaries of videos and actually what
I'm more interested than just a summary

158
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:12,440
I'm more interested than just a summary
 

159
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,070
I'm more interested than just a summary
I'm actually interested in a set of

160
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:14,080
I'm actually interested in a set of
 

161
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,110
I'm actually interested in a set of
notes so this is an example of one of

162
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:17,120
notes so this is an example of one of
 

163
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,710
notes so this is an example of one of
the Stanford overview on Transformers

164
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:19,720
the Stanford overview on Transformers
 

165
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,350
the Stanford overview on Transformers
video you can see here that I've

166
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:22,360
video you can see here that I've
 

167
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,869
video you can see here that I've
basically got a system where I'm

168
00:03:23,869 --> 00:03:23,879
basically got a system where I'm
 

169
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:26,149
basically got a system where I'm
building like a whole bunch of different

170
00:03:26,149 --> 00:03:26,159
building like a whole bunch of different
 

171
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,869
building like a whole bunch of different
notes around different sections of the

172
00:03:28,869 --> 00:03:28,879
notes around different sections of the
 

173
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,149
notes around different sections of the
video going through and putting this

174
00:03:31,149 --> 00:03:31,159
video going through and putting this
 

175
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:32,509
video going through and putting this
together something that I've been

176
00:03:32,509 --> 00:03:32,519
together something that I've been
 

177
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:34,550
together something that I've been
looking at and working on for quite a

178
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:34,560
looking at and working on for quite a
 

179
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,830
looking at and working on for quite a
while with different levels of success

180
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:36,840
while with different levels of success
 

181
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,869
while with different levels of success
in here the whole idea for doing

182
00:03:38,869 --> 00:03:38,879
in here the whole idea for doing
 

183
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,030
in here the whole idea for doing
something like this is that we can

184
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:40,040
something like this is that we can
 

185
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,030
something like this is that we can
basically give it you know a transcript

186
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:42,040
basically give it you know a transcript
 

187
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,910
basically give it you know a transcript
with timestamps and then it can turn

188
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:43,920
with timestamps and then it can turn
 

189
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,229
with timestamps and then it can turn
that into a full set of notes that we

190
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:46,239
that into a full set of notes that we
 

191
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,470
that into a full set of notes that we
can use for a variety of different

192
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:48,480
can use for a variety of different
 

193
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,429
can use for a variety of different
things and so that this sort of brings

194
00:03:50,429 --> 00:03:50,439
things and so that this sort of brings
 

195
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,350
things and so that this sort of brings
us the whole sort of curation aspect

196
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:52,360
us the whole sort of curation aspect
 

197
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,309
us the whole sort of curation aspect
that I'm interested in but then the

198
00:03:54,309 --> 00:03:54,319
that I'm interested in but then the
 

199
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,309
that I'm interested in but then the
other thing that I'm interested in as

200
00:03:56,309 --> 00:03:56,319
other thing that I'm interested in as
 

201
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,589
other thing that I'm interested in as
well is that often you want notes that

202
00:04:00,589 --> 00:04:00,599
well is that often you want notes that
 

203
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:02,589
well is that often you want notes that
are different sometimes you want a full

204
00:04:02,589 --> 00:04:02,599
are different sometimes you want a full
 

205
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:04,390
are different sometimes you want a full
set of notes sometimes you just want a

206
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:04,400
set of notes sometimes you just want a
 

207
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,750
set of notes sometimes you just want a
very short summary sometimes you want

208
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:06,760
very short summary sometimes you want
 

209
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,509
very short summary sometimes you want
action items for going through this and

210
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:09,519
action items for going through this and
 

211
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,149
action items for going through this and
then on top of that you often want to

212
00:04:12,149 --> 00:04:12,159
then on top of that you often want to
 

213
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,830
then on top of that you often want to
basically pick a sort of context that

214
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:14,840
basically pick a sort of context that
 

215
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,229
basically pick a sort of context that
you want the notes in so if I want a set

216
00:04:18,229 --> 00:04:18,239
you want the notes in so if I want a set
 

217
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:20,550
you want the notes in so if I want a set
of notes as an AI researcher that's

218
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:20,560
of notes as an AI researcher that's
 

219
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,270
of notes as an AI researcher that's
quite different than the set of notes

220
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:23,280
quite different than the set of notes
 

221
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,469
quite different than the set of notes
that maybe if I'm trying to skim to

222
00:04:25,469 --> 00:04:25,479
that maybe if I'm trying to skim to
 

223
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:28,070
that maybe if I'm trying to skim to
learn a new topic or a new subject I

224
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,080
learn a new topic or a new subject I
 

225
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,350
learn a new topic or a new subject I
want a set of notes that sort of

226
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:29,360
want a set of notes that sort of
 

227
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,629
want a set of notes that sort of
highlight the statistics mentioned in

228
00:04:31,629 --> 00:04:31,639
highlight the statistics mentioned in
 

229
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:34,310
highlight the statistics mentioned in
there as opposed to just general notes

230
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:34,320
there as opposed to just general notes
 

231
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,189
there as opposed to just general notes
this is the sort of personalization

232
00:04:36,189 --> 00:04:36,199
this is the sort of personalization
 

233
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:38,710
this is the sort of personalization
aspect coming into play here so in the

234
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:38,720
aspect coming into play here so in the
 

235
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,350
aspect coming into play here so in the
app here you can basically come in to

236
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:41,360
app here you can basically come in to
 

237
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,469
app here you can basically come in to
your account and you can set up

238
00:04:43,469 --> 00:04:43,479
your account and you can set up
 

239
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:46,710
your account and you can set up
different kinds of profiles so the idea

240
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:46,720
different kinds of profiles so the idea
 

241
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,950
different kinds of profiles so the idea
here is that you can set up a profile

242
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:48,960
here is that you can set up a profile
 

243
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,070
here is that you can set up a profile
that sets up key sorts of things that

244
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:51,080
that sets up key sorts of things that
 

245
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,270
that sets up key sorts of things that
are interesting to you to get the

246
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:53,280
are interesting to you to get the
 

247
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,230
are interesting to you to get the
information out for a summary and you

248
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:55,240
information out for a summary and you
 

249
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,870
information out for a summary and you
can combine that with a summary type to

250
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:57,880
can combine that with a summary type to
 

251
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,390
can combine that with a summary type to
get a better level of summarization

252
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:00,400
get a better level of summarization
 

253
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,590
get a better level of summarization
and a better level of personalized

254
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:02,600
and a better level of personalized
 

255
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,310
and a better level of personalized
curation that's what I'm going for here

256
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:05,320
curation that's what I'm going for here
 

257
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,150
curation that's what I'm going for here
now the the key thing is what I want to

258
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:07,160
now the the key thing is what I want to
 

259
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,029
now the the key thing is what I want to
talk about more is like some of the key

260
00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:09,039
talk about more is like some of the key
 

261
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,870
talk about more is like some of the key
things around what it took to build

262
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:10,880
things around what it took to build
 

263
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,469
things around what it took to build
something like this and also

264
00:05:12,469 --> 00:05:12,479
something like this and also
 

265
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,390
something like this and also
fundamentally the sort of new way of

266
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:14,400
fundamentally the sort of new way of
 

267
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,390
fundamentally the sort of new way of
thinking about building some of these

268
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:16,400
thinking about building some of these
 

269
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,670
thinking about building some of these
apps and certainly how I've changed over

270
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:18,680
apps and certainly how I've changed over
 

271
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,150
apps and certainly how I've changed over
the last few months now to get into that

272
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:21,160
the last few months now to get into that
 

273
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,230
the last few months now to get into that
we need to talk about like the state of

274
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:23,240
we need to talk about like the state of
 

275
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,950
we need to talk about like the state of
llms so if we go back in history a bit

276
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:26,960
llms so if we go back in history a bit
 

277
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,390
llms so if we go back in history a bit
the idea was that we had a bunch of sort

278
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:29,400
the idea was that we had a bunch of sort
 

279
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,390
the idea was that we had a bunch of sort
of Foundation models if we go back a

280
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:31,400
of Foundation models if we go back a
 

281
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,830
of Foundation models if we go back a
year or two you had some Foundation

282
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:33,840
year or two you had some Foundation
 

283
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,350
year or two you had some Foundation
models from Google you had some

284
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:35,360
models from Google you had some
 

285
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,029
models from Google you had some
Foundation models from open AI maybe one

286
00:05:38,029 --> 00:05:38,039
Foundation models from open AI maybe one
 

287
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:40,670
Foundation models from open AI maybe one
or two other companies there the key

288
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:40,680
or two other companies there the key
 

289
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,710
or two other companies there the key
thing though was that in these

290
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:43,720
thing though was that in these
 

291
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,430
thing though was that in these
Foundation models that everyone was

292
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:45,440
Foundation models that everyone was
 

293
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,150
Foundation models that everyone was
focused on the best quality model now

294
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:49,160
focused on the best quality model now
 

295
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,790
focused on the best quality model now
even though the organizations may have

296
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:50,800
even though the organizations may have
 

297
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,510
even though the organizations may have
had different versions of the model at

298
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:52,520
had different versions of the model at
 

299
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,309
had different versions of the model at
different tiers and stuff like that

300
00:05:54,309 --> 00:05:54,319
different tiers and stuff like that
 

301
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:56,830
different tiers and stuff like that
often they didn't make those public if

302
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:56,840
often they didn't make those public if
 

303
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,270
often they didn't make those public if
we jump forward to now we see that okay

304
00:05:59,270 --> 00:05:59,280
we jump forward to now we see that okay
 

305
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,430
we jump forward to now we see that okay
there's still the big players are still

306
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:01,440
there's still the big players are still
 

307
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,309
there's still the big players are still
the same but we've now got the addition

308
00:06:03,309 --> 00:06:03,319
the same but we've now got the addition
 

309
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:05,830
the same but we've now got the addition
of a lot of other models coming into the

310
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:05,840
of a lot of other models coming into the
 

311
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,990
of a lot of other models coming into the
scene here and these models have caused

312
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:10,000
scene here and these models have caused
 

313
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,469
scene here and these models have caused
everyone to re-evaluate how you're

314
00:06:12,469 --> 00:06:12,479
everyone to re-evaluate how you're
 

315
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,909
everyone to re-evaluate how you're
actually picking a model how you're

316
00:06:13,909 --> 00:06:13,919
actually picking a model how you're
 

317
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,110
actually picking a model how you're
doing things like this so I'd say that

318
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:17,120
doing things like this so I'd say that
 

319
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,830
doing things like this so I'd say that
now we're starting to fall into these

320
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:18,840
now we're starting to fall into these
 

321
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,309
now we're starting to fall into these
categories of best model best quality

322
00:06:22,309 --> 00:06:22,319
categories of best model best quality
 

323
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,350
categories of best model best quality
model which is what most people still

324
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:24,360
model which is what most people still
 

325
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,830
model which is what most people still
judge things about meaning usually the

326
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:26,840
judge things about meaning usually the
 

327
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,710
judge things about meaning usually the
biggest model with the best scores on ML

328
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:29,720
biggest model with the best scores on ML
 

329
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,950
biggest model with the best scores on ML
Lu with the best scores on gsm 8K that

330
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:32,960
Lu with the best scores on gsm 8K that
 

331
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,909
Lu with the best scores on gsm 8K that
kind of thing and then at the other end

332
00:06:34,909 --> 00:06:34,919
kind of thing and then at the other end
 

333
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:36,230
kind of thing and then at the other end
of the the Spectrum which I'm going to

334
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:36,240
of the the Spectrum which I'm going to
 

335
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,710
of the the Spectrum which I'm going to
talk about in a sec is this whole idea

336
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:38,720
talk about in a sec is this whole idea
 

337
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,469
talk about in a sec is this whole idea
of smaller proprietary models that are

338
00:06:41,469 --> 00:06:41,479
of smaller proprietary models that are
 

339
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:42,870
of smaller proprietary models that are
still way bigger than most of the

340
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:42,880
still way bigger than most of the
 

341
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,029
still way bigger than most of the
open-source models but they're much

342
00:06:46,029 --> 00:06:46,039
open-source models but they're much
 

343
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:48,430
open-source models but they're much
faster they can still be used for lots

344
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:48,440
faster they can still be used for lots
 

345
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,550
faster they can still be used for lots
of different tasks and they end up being

346
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:50,560
of different tasks and they end up being
 

347
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,110
of different tasks and they end up being
much cheaper unfortunately there's some

348
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:53,120
much cheaper unfortunately there's some
 

349
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,309
much cheaper unfortunately there's some
models that end up being in the middle

350
00:06:55,309 --> 00:06:55,319
models that end up being in the middle
 

351
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:57,589
models that end up being in the middle
here so you end up with a bunch of these

352
00:06:57,589 --> 00:06:57,599
here so you end up with a bunch of these
 

353
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,950
here so you end up with a bunch of these
models that are in the middle here and

354
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:00,960
models that are in the middle here and
 

355
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,110
models that are in the middle here and
they suffer from being too big to

356
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:04,120
they suffer from being too big to
 

357
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,990
they suffer from being too big to
perhaps run easily quickly cheaply fast

358
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:08,000
perhaps run easily quickly cheaply fast
 

359
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,950
perhaps run easily quickly cheaply fast
or they're just not good quality models

360
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:10,960
or they're just not good quality models
 

361
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,350
or they're just not good quality models
and meaning that they're too big that if

362
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:13,360
and meaning that they're too big that if
 

363
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,309
and meaning that they're too big that if
you look at models on par with them

364
00:07:16,309 --> 00:07:16,319
you look at models on par with them
 

365
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,189
you look at models on par with them
they're just so much better that it's

366
00:07:18,189 --> 00:07:18,199
they're just so much better that it's
 

367
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:20,510
they're just so much better that it's
very hard to justify running a lot of

368
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:20,520
very hard to justify running a lot of
 

369
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,550
very hard to justify running a lot of
these models for this so I think with

370
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:23,560
these models for this so I think with
 

371
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,309
these models for this so I think with
llama 3 coming out recently we've seen a

372
00:07:26,309 --> 00:07:26,319
llama 3 coming out recently we've seen a
 

373
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,029
llama 3 coming out recently we've seen a
lot of the sort of model developers just

374
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:29,039
lot of the sort of model developers just
 

375
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,230
lot of the sort of model developers just
really become a lot less relevant here

376
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:32,240
really become a lot less relevant here
 

377
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,550
really become a lot less relevant here
in in this sort of situation because

378
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:34,560
in in this sort of situation because
 

379
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,830
in in this sort of situation because
people can use llama 3 they can use

380
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:36,840
people can use llama 3 they can use
 

381
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,189
people can use llama 3 they can use
other models if they want to run

382
00:07:38,189 --> 00:07:38,199
other models if they want to run
 

383
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:41,110
other models if they want to run
something small and local or they can go

384
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:41,120
something small and local or they can go
 

385
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,029
something small and local or they can go
for the really big ones if they want the

386
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:43,039
for the really big ones if they want the
 

387
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,550
for the really big ones if they want the
most intelligent model there but being a

388
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:46,560
most intelligent model there but being a
 

389
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,189
most intelligent model there but being a
big model that's not in the top tier of

390
00:07:49,189 --> 00:07:49,199
big model that's not in the top tier of
 

391
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,510
big model that's not in the top tier of
intelligence out there really means that

392
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:52,520
intelligence out there really means that
 

393
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,110
intelligence out there really means that
for a lot of people it's not going to be

394
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:54,120
for a lot of people it's not going to be
 

395
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,790
for a lot of people it's not going to be
a really relevant kind of thing so we've

396
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:56,800
a really relevant kind of thing so we've
 

397
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,950
a really relevant kind of thing so we've
also seen this move to

398
00:07:59,950 --> 00:07:59,960
also seen this move to
 

399
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,550
also seen this move to
having families of models so Google

400
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:02,560
having families of models so Google
 

401
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,029
having families of models so Google
wasn't the first one to do this but when

402
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:05,039
wasn't the first one to do this but when
 

403
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,790
wasn't the first one to do this but when
Gemini announced they basically had a

404
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:07,800
Gemini announced they basically had a
 

405
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,869
Gemini announced they basically had a
whole sort of Suite of models in here

406
00:08:10,869 --> 00:08:10,879
whole sort of Suite of models in here
 

407
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,830
whole sort of Suite of models in here
and so they've you know got Gemini Ultra

408
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:12,840
and so they've you know got Gemini Ultra
 

409
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:16,550
and so they've you know got Gemini Ultra
1.0 Gemini Pro 1.0 the Gemini Nano

410
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:16,560
1.0 Gemini Pro 1.0 the Gemini Nano
 

411
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,589
1.0 Gemini Pro 1.0 the Gemini Nano
models which are really more for mobile

412
00:08:18,589 --> 00:08:18,599
models which are really more for mobile
 

413
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:20,070
models which are really more for mobile
so I'm not going to count them too much

414
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:20,080
so I'm not going to count them too much
 

415
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,670
so I'm not going to count them too much
in this and then you've got things like

416
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:21,680
in this and then you've got things like
 

417
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,350
in this and then you've got things like
Pro 1.5 where they blew out the context

418
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:24,360
Pro 1.5 where they blew out the context
 

419
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,110
Pro 1.5 where they blew out the context
window for the first time to have sort

420
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:26,120
window for the first time to have sort
 

421
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,710
window for the first time to have sort
of a million token context window which

422
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:28,720
of a million token context window which
 

423
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,469
of a million token context window which
is totally awesome it allows for you to

424
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:31,479
is totally awesome it allows for you to
 

425
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:33,389
is totally awesome it allows for you to
do a lot of different multimodal things

426
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:33,399
do a lot of different multimodal things
 

427
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:37,469
do a lot of different multimodal things
of video of audio does it kill rag no

428
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:37,479
of video of audio does it kill rag no
 

429
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:39,709
of video of audio does it kill rag no
not at all this is I think becoming more

430
00:08:39,709 --> 00:08:39,719
not at all this is I think becoming more
 

431
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,310
not at all this is I think becoming more
and more clear to people that rag is

432
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:41,320
and more clear to people that rag is
 

433
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,550
and more clear to people that rag is
still going to be around for a long time

434
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:43,560
still going to be around for a long time
 

435
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,670
still going to be around for a long time
the challenge with models like Gemini

436
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:45,680
the challenge with models like Gemini
 

437
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,470
the challenge with models like Gemini

00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:46,480
Pro
 

439
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,790
Pro
1.5 is that firstly just the speed is

440
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:49,800
1.5 is that firstly just the speed is
 

441
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,670
1.5 is that firstly just the speed is
that it's pretty slow if you put a

442
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:51,680
that it's pretty slow if you put a
 

443
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,509
that it's pretty slow if you put a
million tokens in there it's going to

444
00:08:53,509 --> 00:08:53,519
million tokens in there it's going to
 

445
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,350
million tokens in there it's going to
take a few minutes to give you an answer

446
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:56,360
take a few minutes to give you an answer
 

447
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,910
take a few minutes to give you an answer
for that and the second biggest sort of

448
00:08:58,910 --> 00:08:58,920
for that and the second biggest sort of
 

449
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,509
for that and the second biggest sort of
issue with this is that when you're

450
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:01,519
issue with this is that when you're
 

451
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,829
issue with this is that when you're
doing something out you're only getting

452
00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:03,839
doing something out you're only getting
 

453
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,829
doing something out you're only getting
8,000 tokens you're not getting like a

454
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:06,839
8,000 tokens you're not getting like a
 

455
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,790
8,000 tokens you're not getting like a
full million tokens in million tokens

456
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:09,800
full million tokens in million tokens
 

457
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,949
full million tokens in million tokens
possibly or even a million tokens in

458
00:09:11,949 --> 00:09:11,959
possibly or even a million tokens in
 

459
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:15,150
possibly or even a million tokens in
100,000 you're getting 8K out that means

460
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:15,160
100,000 you're getting 8K out that means
 

461
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,350
100,000 you're getting 8K out that means
that currently in the state that they're

462
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:17,360
that currently in the state that they're
 

463
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,550
that currently in the state that they're
in now these models and it's not just

464
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:19,560
in now these models and it's not just
 

465
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,190
in now these models and it's not just
the Gemini ones it's from other

466
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:21,200
the Gemini ones it's from other
 

467
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,870
the Gemini ones it's from other
providers as well are not something that

468
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:23,880
providers as well are not something that
 

469
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,550
providers as well are not something that
you can basically use for a long output

470
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:27,560
you can basically use for a long output
 

471
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,790
you can basically use for a long output
so if you think about it there are lots

472
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:28,800
so if you think about it there are lots
 

473
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,870
so if you think about it there are lots
of use cas for long outputs out there if

474
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:31,880
of use cas for long outputs out there if
 

475
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,470
of use cas for long outputs out there if
you want to write a book or more

476
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:33,480
you want to write a book or more
 

477
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,110
you want to write a book or more
importantly if you want to edit a book

478
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:35,120
importantly if you want to edit a book
 

479
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,069
importantly if you want to edit a book
where you basically give it a whole book

480
00:09:38,069 --> 00:09:38,079
where you basically give it a whole book
 

481
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:40,710
where you basically give it a whole book
to and have it go through and change all

482
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:40,720
to and have it go through and change all
 

483
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,550
to and have it go through and change all
the time it sees a name or something

484
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:42,560
the time it sees a name or something
 

485
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,870
the time it sees a name or something
like that or do certain kinds of things

486
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:44,880
like that or do certain kinds of things
 

487
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,550
like that or do certain kinds of things
in there that perhaps a little bit more

488
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:46,560
in there that perhaps a little bit more
 

489
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,310
in there that perhaps a little bit more
complicated than just find and replace

490
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:49,320
complicated than just find and replace
 

491
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,150
complicated than just find and replace
it would be great if we could go 100,000

492
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:51,160
it would be great if we could go 100,000
 

493
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,710
it would be great if we could go 100,000

495
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,590
tokens in 100,000 tokens out at a time
but unfortunately that's not the case

496
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:55,600
but unfortunately that's not the case
 

497
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,990
but unfortunately that's not the case
another use case of this would be

498
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:57,000
another use case of this would be
 

499
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,949
another use case of this would be
transcribing long audio so why while

open AI will keep improving the models
that at a rapid Pace I think there's

540
00:10:47,389 --> 00:10:47,399
that at a rapid Pace I think there's
 

541
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:48,670
that at a rapid Pace I think there's
like a middle ground here there's

542
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:48,680
like a middle ground here there's
 

543
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,230
like a middle ground here there's
actually a third option that yes the

547
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,230
models are definitely going to get
better this year we're going to see

548
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:54,240
better this year we're going to see
 

549
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,829
better this year we're going to see
better models out with perhaps new GPT

550
00:10:56,829 --> 00:10:56,839
better models out with perhaps new GPT
 

551
00:10:56,839 --> 00:10:59,269
better models out with perhaps new GPT
models new Gemini models new Claude

552
00:10:59,269 --> 00:10:59,279
models new Gemini models new Claude
 

553
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,750

models later in the year that kind of

554
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:00,760
models later in the year that kind of
 

555
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,430
models later in the year that kind of
thing but even with those models getting

556
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:04,440
thing but even with those models getting
 

557
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,069
thing but even with those models getting
better we have to ship products with

558
00:11:07,069 --> 00:11:07,079
better we have to ship products with
 

559
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:09,350
better we have to ship products with
what we've got now and we have to find

560
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:09,360
what we've got now and we have to find
 

561
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,069
what we've got now and we have to find
new ways to be able to do things with

562
00:11:12,069 --> 00:11:12,079
new ways to be able to do things with
 

563
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,470
new ways to be able to do things with
what we've got now and this brings me to

564
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:14,480
what we've got now and this brings me to
 

565
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,590
what we've got now and this brings me to
the idea of making use of this new class

566
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:17,600
the idea of making use of this new class
 

567
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,110
the idea of making use of this new class
of model that's coming out so the one

568
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:21,120
of model that's coming out so the one
 

569
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,150
of model that's coming out so the one
that I'm going to focus on is Hau in

570
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:24,160
that I'm going to focus on is Hau in
 

571
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,430
that I'm going to focus on is Hau in
here but there are others coming from

572
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:26,440
here but there are others coming from
 

573
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,509
here but there are others coming from
other players as well this is I think

574
00:11:28,509 --> 00:11:28,519
other players as well this is I think
 

575
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:29,750
other players as well this is I think
Haiku was probably

576
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:29,760
Haiku was probably
 

577
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,069
Haiku was probably
one of the first ones out like this so

578
00:11:32,069 --> 00:11:32,079
one of the first ones out like this so
 

579
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,509
one of the first ones out like this so
the thing that I would say about this

580
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:33,519
the thing that I would say about this
 

581
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,310
the thing that I would say about this
new sort of tier of models is that these

582
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:36,320
new sort of tier of models is that these
 

583
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,190
new sort of tier of models is that these
models are getting very strong

584
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:38,200
models are getting very strong
 

585
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,949
models are getting very strong
benchmarks they're not the best so for

586
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:40,959
benchmarks they're not the best so for
 

587
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,670
benchmarks they're not the best so for
example in the Claude 3 obviously the

588
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:43,680
example in the Claude 3 obviously the
 

589
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,590
example in the Claude 3 obviously the
Opus model is the big model with Sonet

590
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:46,600
Opus model is the big model with Sonet
 

591
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,430
Opus model is the big model with Sonet
being the middle one Hau being lower one

592
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:49,440
being the middle one Hau being lower one
 

593
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,750
being the middle one Hau being lower one
these new models are not the best models

594
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:51,760
these new models are not the best models
 

595
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,110
these new models are not the best models
out there but they have very strong

596
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:54,120
out there but they have very strong
 

597
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,670
out there but they have very strong
benchmarks and on top of those

598
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:56,680
benchmarks and on top of those
 

599
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,870
benchmarks and on top of those
benchmarks they're super performant

600
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:58,880
benchmarks they're super performant
 

601
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,509
benchmarks they're super performant
meaning that their speed is really good

602
00:12:02,509 --> 00:12:02,519
meaning that their speed is really good
 

603
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:04,870
meaning that their speed is really good
they have still have very big context

604
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:04,880
they have still have very big context
 

605
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,230
they have still have very big context
windows for putting things in and

606
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:07,240
windows for putting things in and
 

607
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,829
windows for putting things in and
generally the tokens are going to be

608
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:08,839
generally the tokens are going to be
 

609
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:12,030
generally the tokens are going to be
quite cheap in this so if we look at why

610
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:12,040
quite cheap in this so if we look at why
 

611
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,430
quite cheap in this so if we look at why
kou that I'm focusing on here is that

612
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:15,440
kou that I'm focusing on here is that
 

613
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,230
kou that I'm focusing on here is that
we've got something that one is

614
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:17,240
we've got something that one is
 

615
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,389
we've got something that one is
multimodal that two we've got a really

616
00:12:19,389 --> 00:12:19,399
multimodal that two we've got a really
 

617
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:21,350
multimodal that two we've got a really
long context window if we want to go out

618
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:21,360
long context window if we want to go out
 

619
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,430
long context window if we want to go out
to that context window we've got

620
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:23,440
to that context window we've got
 

621
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,629
to that context window we've got
something that is super cheap in here if

622
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:26,639
something that is super cheap in here if
 

623
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,550
something that is super cheap in here if
we look at the the pricing in here we

624
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:28,560
we look at the the pricing in here we
 

625
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,509
we look at the the pricing in here we
can see that Hau is only 25 cents per

626
00:12:32,509 --> 00:12:32,519
can see that Hau is only 25 cents per
 

627
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:35,350
can see that Hau is only 25 cents per
million tokens input and 125 per million

628
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:35,360
million tokens input and 125 per million
 

629
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,750
million tokens input and 125 per million
tokens output comparing that to the top

630
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:37,760
tokens output comparing that to the top
 

631
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,470
tokens output comparing that to the top
of the line where it's

632
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:39,480
of the line where it's
 

633
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,990
of the line where it's
$15 for the input tokens and $75 out for

634
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:43,000
$15 for the input tokens and $75 out for
 

635
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,590
$15 for the input tokens and $75 out for
the output tokens so this cheapness

636
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:46,600
the output tokens so this cheapness
 

637
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,310
the output tokens so this cheapness
allows us to do a lot of different

638
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:48,320
allows us to do a lot of different
 

639
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,590
allows us to do a lot of different
things and then the speed comes in

640
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:51,600
things and then the speed comes in
 

641
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,750
things and then the speed comes in
totally you know for this the whole idea

642
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:53,760
totally you know for this the whole idea
 

643
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,629
totally you know for this the whole idea
of having a very fast model really

644
00:12:56,629 --> 00:12:56,639
of having a very fast model really
 

645
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,069
of having a very fast model really
changes the game in what you can do with

646
00:13:00,069 --> 00:13:00,079
changes the game in what you can do with
 

647
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,269
changes the game in what you can do with
these kind of things now the other sort

648
00:13:02,269 --> 00:13:02,279
these kind of things now the other sort
 

649
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:04,150
these kind of things now the other sort
of example of this that I would say that

650
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:04,160
of example of this that I would say that
 

651
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,430
of example of this that I would say that
we're seeing at the moment which is

652
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:05,440
we're seeing at the moment which is
 

653
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,430
we're seeing at the moment which is
pretty good is meta's Lama 3 Model on

654
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:08,440
pretty good is meta's Lama 3 Model on
 

655
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,870

Gro or powered by grock as they like to
 

657
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,910
Gro or powered by grock as they like to
say so that basically allows you to get

658
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:13,920
say so that basically allows you to get
 

659
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,910
say so that basically allows you to get
very fast tokens out it's very

660
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:16,920
very fast tokens out it's very
 

661
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,870
very fast tokens out it's very
performant in these kind of ways and we

662
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:18,880
performant in these kind of ways and we
 

663
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,069
performant in these kind of ways and we
know that the Llama 3 model 70 billion

664
00:13:21,069 --> 00:13:21,079
know that the Llama 3 model 70 billion
 

665
00:13:21,079 --> 00:13:23,430
know that the Llama 3 model 70 billion
model is actually a very good model for

666
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:23,440

long stuff the only issue with this one

668
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:25,800
long stuff the only issue with this one
 

669
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,550
long stuff the only issue with this one
currently is the lack of multimodality

670
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:28,560
currently is the lack of multimodality

Jason for putting things in and out on
 

745
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,550
Jason for putting things in and out on
the whole though that's not something

746
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:55,560
the whole though that's not something
 

747
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,710
the whole though that's not something
that's really key and then the the sort

748
00:14:58,710 --> 00:14:58,720
that's really key and then the the sort
 

749
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,910
that's really key and then the the sort
of last thing I would say is so when

00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:00,920
of last thing I would say is so when
 

751
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,189
of last thing I would say is so when
we're talking about this new area of

00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,550
we're talking about this new area of
smaller proprietary models that's out

smaller proprietary models that's out
 

755

smaller proprietary models that's out
there one of the biggest advantages here

756
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:09,040
there one of the biggest advantages here
 

757
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,030
there one of the biggest advantages here
is that you can basically add more in

758
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:12,040
is that you can basically add more in
 

759
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,269
is that you can basically add more in
context learning right so you can add

760
00:15:14,269 --> 00:15:14,279
context learning right so you can add
 

761
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:16,790
context learning right so you can add
more few shot examples and where in the

762
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:16,800
more few shot examples and where in the
 

763
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,150
more few shot examples and where in the
past people would go for sort of three

764
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:19,160
past people would go for sort of three
 

765
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,749
past people would go for sort of three
shot or five shot maybe eight shot for

766
00:15:21,749 --> 00:15:21,759
shot or five shot maybe eight shot for
 

767
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:23,110
shot or five shot maybe eight shot for
the few shot

768
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:23,120
the few shot
 

769
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,110
the few shot
examples now it's not a big deal to go

770
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:26,120
examples now it's not a big deal to go
 

771
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:31,110
examples now it's not a big deal to go
for 20 30 50 different examples in here

772
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:31,120
for 20 30 50 different examples in here
 

773
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,230
for 20 30 50 different examples in here
and recently there was a really

774
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:32,240
and recently there was a really
 

775
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,189
and recently there was a really
interesting paper that came out that

776
00:15:35,189 --> 00:15:35,199
interesting paper that came out that
 

777
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,189
interesting paper that came out that
came out from Google deep mine called

778
00:15:37,189 --> 00:15:37,199
came out from Google deep mine called
 

779
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,749
came out from Google deep mine called
many shot in context learning and the

780
00:15:39,749 --> 00:15:39,759
many shot in context learning and the
 

781
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,470
many shot in context learning and the
idea here in the paper is that they

782
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:42,480
idea here in the paper is that they
 

783
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,230
idea here in the paper is that they
rather than where conventionally people

784
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:44,240
rather than where conventionally people
 

785
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,990
rather than where conventionally people
are using three to eight sort of

786
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:46,000
are using three to eight sort of
 

787
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,389
are using three to eight sort of
examples they started what would happen

788
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:48,399
examples they started what would happen
 

789
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,430
examples they started what would happen
if you went to 50 examples if you went

790
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:50,440
if you went to 50 examples if you went
 

791
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,749
if you went to 50 examples if you went
to 500 if you went to 2,000 examples

792
00:15:53,749 --> 00:15:53,759
to 500 if you went to 2,000 examples
 

793
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,189
to 500 if you went to 2,000 examples
here and you can see that for a variety

794
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:56,199
here and you can see that for a variety
 

795
00:15:56,199 --> 00:15:58,790
here and you can see that for a variety
of different benchmarks that they looked

796
00:15:58,790 --> 00:15:58,800
of different benchmarks that they looked
 

797
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,910
of different benchmarks that they looked
at just massively increasing the number

798
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:01,920
at just massively increasing the number
 

799
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,269
at just massively increasing the number
of exemplars or examples that they're

800
00:16:04,269 --> 00:16:04,279
of exemplars or examples that they're
 

801
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:06,949
of exemplars or examples that they're
passing in allowed the models to do a

802
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:06,959
passing in allowed the models to do a
 

803
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,509
passing in allowed the models to do a
lot better so you can see a bump for the

804
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:09,519
lot better so you can see a bump for the
 

805
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,269
lot better so you can see a bump for the
many shot Ico versions now you can see

806
00:16:12,269 --> 00:16:12,279
many shot Ico versions now you can see
 

807
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:14,350
many shot Ico versions now you can see
that some of these are going like 512

808
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:14,360
that some of these are going like 512
 

809
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:19,949
that some of these are going like 512
examples 128 50 248 Etc and the thing is

810
00:16:19,949 --> 00:16:19,959
examples 128 50 248 Etc and the thing is
 

811
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:21,509
examples 128 50 248 Etc and the thing is
there's also been some papers that are

812
00:16:21,509 --> 00:16:21,519
there's also been some papers that are
 

813
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,350
there's also been some papers that are
showing some really interesting things

814
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:23,360
showing some really interesting things
 

815
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,910
showing some really interesting things
that the more few shot examples you're

816
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:25,920
that the more few shot examples you're
 

817
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,470
that the more few shot examples you're
using you're actually then starting to

818
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:28,480
using you're actually then starting to
 

819
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,990
using you're actually then starting to
make it more like you're fine-tuning the

820
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:31,000
make it more like you're fine-tuning the
 

821
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,030
make it more like you're fine-tuning the
model in the way that you want it to go

822
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:33,040
model in the way that you want it to go
 

823
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,749
model in the way that you want it to go
as well that seems to be the case

824
00:16:34,749 --> 00:16:34,759
as well that seems to be the case
 

825
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:38,150
as well that seems to be the case
especially with these proprietary models

826
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:38,160
especially with these proprietary models
 

827
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,309
especially with these proprietary models
often perhaps even more so than the

828
00:16:40,309 --> 00:16:40,319
often perhaps even more so than the
 

829
00:16:40,319 --> 00:16:43,030
often perhaps even more so than the
open-source models that are out there so

830
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:43,040
open-source models that are out there so
 

831
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:48,509
open-source models that are out there so
using exemplars and examples in Hau is a

832
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:48,519
using exemplars and examples in Hau is a
 

833
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:50,749
using exemplars and examples in Hau is a
really good thing that you can do to

834
00:16:50,749 --> 00:16:50,759
really good thing that you can do to
 

835
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:53,309
really good thing that you can do to
basically guide the model and you tend

836
00:16:53,309 --> 00:16:53,319
basically guide the model and you tend
 

837
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:55,829
basically guide the model and you tend
to wrap them in XML tags here so you can

838
00:16:55,829 --> 00:16:55,839
to wrap them in XML tags here so you can
 

839
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,990
to wrap them in XML tags here so you can
see I've got an example here are eight

840
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:58,000
see I've got an example here are eight
 

841
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,509
see I've got an example here are eight
examples of great math with step by step

842
00:17:00,509 --> 00:17:00,519
examples of great math with step by step
 

843
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,309
examples of great math with step by step
then we just wrap them and stuff like

844
00:17:02,309 --> 00:17:02,319
then we just wrap them and stuff like
 

845
00:17:02,319 --> 00:17:04,870
then we just wrap them and stuff like
that the model then is able to work this

846
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:04,880
that the model then is able to work this
 

847
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,029
that the model then is able to work this
out and it's going to then be much more

848
00:17:07,029 --> 00:17:07,039
out and it's going to then be much more
 

849
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,270
out and it's going to then be much more
primed to give a better response on

850
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:10,280
primed to give a better response on
 

851
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,470
primed to give a better response on
these kind of things now this not only

852
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:12,480
these kind of things now this not only
 

853
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,710
these kind of things now this not only
works for things like this it also works

854
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:15,720
works for things like this it also works
 

855
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,829
works for things like this it also works
for things like any sort of function

856
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:17,839
for things like any sort of function
 

857
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:20,630
for things like any sort of function
calling any sort of react prompting

858
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:20,640
calling any sort of react prompting
 

859
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,110
calling any sort of react prompting
anything where you're trying to get it

860
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:22,120
anything where you're trying to get it
 

861
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,949
anything where you're trying to get it
to make decisions and stuff the more

862
00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:24,959
to make decisions and stuff the more
 

863
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,309
to make decisions and stuff the more
examples that you can stuff in there the

864
00:17:27,309 --> 00:17:27,319
examples that you can stuff in there the
 

865
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:29,310
examples that you can stuff in there the
better the quality that you get coming

866
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:29,320
better the quality that you get coming
 

867
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,950
better the quality that you get coming
out of there all right and this brings

868
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:30,960
out of there all right and this brings
 

869
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,190
out of there all right and this brings
us to summarization so I showed you the

870
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:33,200
us to summarization so I showed you the
 

871
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,070
us to summarization so I showed you the
app a little bit before here

872
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:35,080
app a little bit before here
 

873
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,110
app a little bit before here
summarization has been a challenge for

874
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:38,120
summarization has been a challenge for
 

875
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,789
summarization has been a challenge for
natural language understanding and

876
00:17:39,789 --> 00:17:39,799
natural language understanding and
 

877
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:41,470
natural language understanding and
natural language processing people for

878
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:41,480
natural language processing people for
 

879
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,350
natural language processing people for
quite a long time now in the past

880
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:44,360
quite a long time now in the past
 

881
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,430
quite a long time now in the past
everything was extractive versus

882
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:46,440
everything was extractive versus
 

883
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,590
everything was extractive versus
abstractive you know with extractive

884
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:48,600
abstractive you know with extractive
 

885
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,150
abstractive you know with extractive
being where you're basically just

886
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:50,160
being where you're basically just
 

887
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,870
being where you're basically just
pulling out sentences from the original

888
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:53,880
pulling out sentences from the original
 

889
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,990
pulling out sentences from the original
document or from what someone said on a

890
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:56,000
document or from what someone said on a
 

891
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,630
document or from what someone said on a
video that kind of thing and abstractive

892
00:17:58,630 --> 00:17:58,640
video that kind of thing and abstractive
 

893
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,070
video that kind of thing and abstractive
has been where we're doing like

894
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:00,080
has been where we're doing like
 

895
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,909
has been where we're doing like
rewriting for this kind of thing but I'm

896
00:18:02,909 --> 00:18:02,919
rewriting for this kind of thing but I'm
 

897
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:04,830
rewriting for this kind of thing but I'm
going to say that nowadays you actually

898
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:04,840
going to say that nowadays you actually
 

899
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,310
going to say that nowadays you actually
want to think about summarization in

900
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:07,320
want to think about summarization in
 

901
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,430
want to think about summarization in
some different ways most summarization

902
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:09,440
some different ways most summarization
 

903
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,950
some different ways most summarization
now is going to be abstractive

904
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:10,960
now is going to be abstractive
 

905
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,669
now is going to be abstractive
summarization but you really want to

906
00:18:12,669 --> 00:18:12,679
summarization but you really want to
 

907
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:14,470
summarization but you really want to
think about summarization as

908
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:14,480
think about summarization as
 

909
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,950
think about summarization as
personalized summarization so this is

910
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:16,960
personalized summarization so this is
 

911
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,789
personalized summarization so this is
tailoring the summaries to user

912
00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:18,799
tailoring the summaries to user
 

913
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,950
tailoring the summaries to user
preferences or user interests

914
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:20,960
preferences or user interests
 

915
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,190
preferences or user interests
aspect-based

916
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:22,200
aspect-based
 

917
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,909
aspect-based
summarization where you're getting the

918
00:18:24,909 --> 00:18:24,919
summarization where you're getting the
 

919
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:28,029
summarization where you're getting the
summary to include very specific things

920
00:18:28,029 --> 00:18:28,039
summary to include very specific things
 

921
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:30,710
summary to include very specific things
like facts and figures statistics that

922
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:30,720
like facts and figures statistics that
 

923
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,430
like facts and figures statistics that
kind of thing so that it doesn't try and

924
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:32,440
kind of thing so that it doesn't try and
 

925
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,549
kind of thing so that it doesn't try and
summarize those Concepts it puts those

926
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:34,559
summarize those Concepts it puts those
 

927
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,870
summarize those Concepts it puts those
in as it's sort of getting them and then

928
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:37,880
in as it's sort of getting them and then
 

929
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,190
in as it's sort of getting them and then
there's a whole sort of field of

930
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:39,200
there's a whole sort of field of
 

931
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,430
there's a whole sort of field of
dialogue summarization that when you're

932
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:41,440
dialogue summarization that when you're
 

933
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,430
dialogue summarization that when you're
actually building something to summarize

934
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:43,440
actually building something to summarize
 

935
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,070
actually building something to summarize
interviews and conversations is actually

936
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:46,080
interviews and conversations is actually
 

937
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,669
interviews and conversations is actually
quite different than when you're trying

938
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:47,679
quite different than when you're trying
 

939
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,390
quite different than when you're trying
to just summarize General presentations

940
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:51,400
to just summarize General presentations
 

941
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,510
to just summarize General presentations
or teaching videos that kind of thing so

942
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:54,520
or teaching videos that kind of thing so
 

943
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,110
or teaching videos that kind of thing so
let's look at some of the ways that

944
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:56,120
let's look at some of the ways that
 

945
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:00,390
let's look at some of the ways that
people do summarization with M so the

946
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:00,400
people do summarization with M so the
 

947
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,070
people do summarization with M so the
best way if you can do it is basically

948
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:03,080
best way if you can do it is basically
 

949
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,870
best way if you can do it is basically
just to have your input documents a

950
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:05,880
just to have your input documents a
 

951
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,350
just to have your input documents a
prompt going into the llm and then

952
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:08,360
prompt going into the llm and then
 

953
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,549
prompt going into the llm and then
coming out with the summary in one shot

954
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:10,559
coming out with the summary in one shot
 

955
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:11,789
coming out with the summary in one shot
this is what we would call Simple

956
00:19:11,789 --> 00:19:11,799
this is what we would call Simple
 

957
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:14,390
this is what we would call Simple
stuffing for this and while this can get

958
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:14,400
stuffing for this and while this can get
 

959
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,230
stuffing for this and while this can get
really good results the challenge here

960
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:16,240
really good results the challenge here
 

961
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,190
really good results the challenge here
is that you can't do it for really big

962
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:18,200
is that you can't do it for really big
 

963
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,950
is that you can't do it for really big
documents and certainly in the past

964
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:19,960
documents and certainly in the past
 

965
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,149
documents and certainly in the past
people couldn't do this so in the past

966
00:19:22,149 --> 00:19:22,159
people couldn't do this so in the past
 

967
00:19:22,159 --> 00:19:24,070
people couldn't do this so in the past
one of the big things people did was map

968
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:24,080
one of the big things people did was map
 

969
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,470
one of the big things people did was map
produce so where You' basically take

970
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:26,480
produce so where You' basically take
 

971
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,870
produce so where You' basically take
your document you break it up into to

972
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:28,880
your document you break it up into to
 

973
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,750
your document you break it up into to
chunks you then pass the chunks through

974
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:31,760
chunks you then pass the chunks through
 

975
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,789
chunks you then pass the chunks through
one at a time to the llm with a prompt

976
00:19:34,789 --> 00:19:34,799
one at a time to the llm with a prompt
 

977
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,510
one at a time to the llm with a prompt
and you get multiple summaries out which

978
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:37,520
and you get multiple summaries out which
 

979
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,669
and you get multiple summaries out which
you then combine in some way shape or

980
00:19:39,669 --> 00:19:39,679
you then combine in some way shape or
 

981
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,630
you then combine in some way shape or
form this has been very you know popular

982
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:42,640
form this has been very you know popular
 

983
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,750
form this has been very you know popular
with Lang chain from the start people

984
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:44,760
with Lang chain from the start people
 

985
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,549
with Lang chain from the start people
used this kind of thing the biggest

986
00:19:46,549 --> 00:19:46,559
used this kind of thing the biggest
 

987
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,590
used this kind of thing the biggest
challenge that you have here is that if

988
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:49,600
challenge that you have here is that if
 

989
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,149
challenge that you have here is that if
you have something in chunk number two

990
00:19:53,149 --> 00:19:53,159
you have something in chunk number two
 

991
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:55,510
you have something in chunk number two
that refers to Something in chunk number

992
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:55,520
that refers to Something in chunk number
 

993
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,789
that refers to Something in chunk number
seven those are not in context at the

994
00:19:57,789 --> 00:19:57,799
seven those are not in context at the
 

995
00:19:57,799 --> 00:20:00,710
seven those are not in context at the
same time so it's much harder for it to

996
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:00,720
same time so it's much harder for it to
 

997
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,830
same time so it's much harder for it to
be able to pick up that you should be

998
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:02,840
be able to pick up that you should be
 

999
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,549
be able to pick up that you should be
taking this and you should be taking

1000
00:20:04,549 --> 00:20:04,559
taking this and you should be taking
 

1001
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,070
taking this and you should be taking
something else in in there a sort of

1002
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:07,080
something else in in there a sort of
 

1003
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,789
something else in in there a sort of
variation on this that people used a lot

1004
00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:08,799
variation on this that people used a lot
 

1005
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,909
variation on this that people used a lot
to was refining over calls so each time

1006
00:20:11,909 --> 00:20:11,919
to was refining over calls so each time
 

1007
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,669
to was refining over calls so each time
we're passing in our summary and adding

1008
00:20:14,669 --> 00:20:14,679
we're passing in our summary and adding
 

1009
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:16,430
we're passing in our summary and adding
to it and keeping what we had from

1010
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:16,440
to it and keeping what we had from
 

1011
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,710
to it and keeping what we had from
before deciding what is more important

1012
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:18,720
before deciding what is more important
 

1013
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,149
before deciding what is more important
that kind of for going through this

1014
00:20:21,149 --> 00:20:21,159
that kind of for going through this
 

1015
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:23,350
that kind of for going through this
there are also techniques where people

1016
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:23,360
there are also techniques where people
 

1017
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,029
there are also techniques where people
do reranking of of the chunks to work

1018
00:20:26,029 --> 00:20:26,039
do reranking of of the chunks to work
 

1019
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:28,390
do reranking of of the chunks to work
out which chunks are the ones with the

1020
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:28,400
out which chunks are the ones with the
 

1021
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,270
out which chunks are the ones with the
most

1022
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:29,280
most
 

1023
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,190
most
with the best information in there so

1024
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:32,200
with the best information in there so
 

1025
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,190
with the best information in there so
what I want to show you is a new way

1026
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:34,200
what I want to show you is a new way
 

1027
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,190
what I want to show you is a new way
that I've been doing summarization for

1028
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:36,200
that I've been doing summarization for
 

1029
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,549
that I've been doing summarization for
this app and how it works going through

1030
00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:38,559
this app and how it works going through
 

1031
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,350
this app and how it works going through
this so because you're using something

1032
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:40,360
this so because you're using something
 

1033
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,310
this so because you're using something
like Hau where it's quite cheap Etc

1034
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:42,320
like Hau where it's quite cheap Etc
 

1035
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,310
like Hau where it's quite cheap Etc
you're going to do multiple calls to the

1036
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:44,320
you're going to do multiple calls to the
 

1037
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,430
you're going to do multiple calls to the
llm but the calls are going to be

1038
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:46,440
llm but the calls are going to be
 

1039
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,029
llm but the calls are going to be
slightly different than just something

1040
00:20:48,029 --> 00:20:48,039
slightly different than just something
 

1041
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:50,230
slightly different than just something
like map produce or something so the

1042
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:50,240
like map produce or something so the
 

1043
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,110
like map produce or something so the
first call is going to basically get

1044
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:53,120
first call is going to basically get
 

1045
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,029
first call is going to basically get
sort of sectioning information from this

1046
00:20:56,029 --> 00:20:56,039
sort of sectioning information from this
 

1047
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:58,029
sort of sectioning information from this
now if I go back to the example that we

1048
00:20:58,029 --> 00:20:58,039
now if I go back to the example that we
 

1049
00:20:58,039 --> 00:20:59,510
now if I go back to the example that we
had here you can see that we've got

1050
00:20:59,510 --> 00:20:59,520
had here you can see that we've got
 

1051
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,470
had here you can see that we've got
sections being extracted out those are

1052
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:01,480
sections being extracted out those are
 

1053
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,270
sections being extracted out those are
not fixed sections the model is deciding

1054
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:04,280
not fixed sections the model is deciding
 

1055
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,549
not fixed sections the model is deciding
when the topic changes from one thing to

1056
00:21:06,549 --> 00:21:06,559
when the topic changes from one thing to
 

1057
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,310
when the topic changes from one thing to
another so this whole idea is what I

1058
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:09,320
another so this whole idea is what I
 

1059
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,430
another so this whole idea is what I
would call sectioning so our first call

1060
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:11,440
would call sectioning so our first call
 

1061
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,870
would call sectioning so our first call
would be like a sectioning call then

1062
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:13,880
would be like a sectioning call then
 

1063
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,909
would be like a sectioning call then
what we do is we basically pass in the

1064
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:16,919
what we do is we basically pass in the
 

1065
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:20,590
what we do is we basically pass in the
full document for each time but tell it

1066
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:20,600
full document for each time but tell it
 

1067
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,110
full document for each time but tell it
just to summarize that particular

1068
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:23,120
just to summarize that particular
 

1069
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,510
just to summarize that particular
section so we give it the time stamps

1070
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:25,520
section so we give it the time stamps
 

1071
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,029
section so we give it the time stamps
and stuff like that and so the summary

1072
00:21:28,029 --> 00:21:28,039
and stuff like that and so the summary
 

1073
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:30,549
and stuff like that and so the summary
that it's put out here is just for this

1074
00:21:30,549 --> 00:21:30,559
that it's put out here is just for this
 

1075
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,470
that it's put out here is just for this
section even though I'm giving it the

1076
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:32,480
section even though I'm giving it the
 

1077
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,390
section even though I'm giving it the
full document the advantage of this is

1078
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:35,400
full document the advantage of this is
 

1079
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,430
full document the advantage of this is
that if something in that part of the

1080
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:38,440
that if something in that part of the
 

1081
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,230
that if something in that part of the
document refers to another section it's

1082
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:41,240
document refers to another section it's
 

1083
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,390
document refers to another section it's
got that in its context learning that it

1084
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:43,400
got that in its context learning that it
 

1085
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,070
got that in its context learning that it
can actually use that to still summarize

1086
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:46,080
can actually use that to still summarize
 

1087
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,590
can actually use that to still summarize
this section in here so you've got the

1088
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:48,600
this section in here so you've got the
 

1089
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,510
this section in here so you've got the
advantage because we've got these long

1090
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:50,520
advantage because we've got these long
 

1091
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,789
advantage because we've got these long
context Windows of being able to put in

1092
00:21:53,789 --> 00:21:53,799
context Windows of being able to put in
 

1093
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:56,510
context Windows of being able to put in
full 30,000 tokens or something for a

1094
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:56,520
full 30,000 tokens or something for a
 

1095
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,110
full 30,000 tokens or something for a
YouTube video but then we've got the

1096
00:21:59,110 --> 00:21:59,120
YouTube video but then we've got the
 

1097
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,310
YouTube video but then we've got the
benefit of basically getting out

1098
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:01,320
benefit of basically getting out
 

1099
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,350
benefit of basically getting out
individual summaries which when combined

1100
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:04,360
individual summaries which when combined
 

1101
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:08,430
individual summaries which when combined
can be far longer than the 8,000 token

1102
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:08,440
can be far longer than the 8,000 token
 

1103
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,630
can be far longer than the 8,000 token
window that we get out for something

1104
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:10,640
window that we get out for something
 

1105
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,590
window that we get out for something
like this so using Haiku here allows us

1106
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:14,600
like this so using Haiku here allows us
 

1107
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,070
like this so using Haiku here allows us
to get a very large amount of input

1108
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:17,080
to get a very large amount of input
 

1109
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,870
to get a very large amount of input
tokens very cheap Hau itself is good

1110
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:19,880
tokens very cheap Hau itself is good
 

1111
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,789
tokens very cheap Hau itself is good
enough generally to discover the

1112
00:22:21,789 --> 00:22:21,799
enough generally to discover the
 

1113
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:24,789
enough generally to discover the
sections if you wanted a better way of

1114
00:22:24,789 --> 00:22:24,799
sections if you wanted a better way of
 

1115
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,390
sections if you wanted a better way of
getting the sections you can actually go

1116
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:26,400
getting the sections you can actually go
 

1117
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,750
getting the sections you can actually go
for a bigger model for that first call

1118
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:28,760
for a bigger model for that first call
 

1119
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,269
for a bigger model for that first call
to get your sections and then just pass

1120
00:22:31,269 --> 00:22:31,279
to get your sections and then just pass
 

1121
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:34,269
to get your sections and then just pass
it into the Hau for the rest again here

1122
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:34,279
it into the Hau for the rest again here
 

1123
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:37,070
it into the Hau for the rest again here
because you're using a model which is

1124
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:37,080
because you're using a model which is
 

1125
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,710
because you're using a model which is
extremely cheap and still very fast you

1126
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:40,720
extremely cheap and still very fast you
 

1127
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,950
extremely cheap and still very fast you
shouldn't be afraid of having long

1128
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:42,960
shouldn't be afraid of having long
 

1129
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,789
shouldn't be afraid of having long
prompts or long contacts in there not

1130
00:22:45,789 --> 00:22:45,799
prompts or long contacts in there not
 

1131
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:48,430
prompts or long contacts in there not
only can you put the full context of the

1132
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:48,440
only can you put the full context of the
 

1133
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,590
only can you put the full context of the
the video in there you can also put a

1134
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:50,600
the video in there you can also put a
 

1135
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,630
the video in there you can also put a
bunch of different fuse shot examples in

1136
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:52,640
bunch of different fuse shot examples in
 

1137
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,110
bunch of different fuse shot examples in
there of how you want certain things to

1138
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:55,120
there of how you want certain things to
 

1139
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,789
there of how you want certain things to
be pulled out for it for that kind of

1140
00:22:57,789 --> 00:22:57,799
be pulled out for it for that kind of
 

1141
00:22:57,799 --> 00:23:00,149
be pulled out for it for that kind of
thing and this stage like 40,000 tokens

1142
00:23:00,149 --> 00:23:00,159
thing and this stage like 40,000 tokens
 

1143
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,789
thing and this stage like 40,000 tokens
is only going to be one cent for this so

1144
00:23:02,789 --> 00:23:02,799
is only going to be one cent for this so
 

1145
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,149
is only going to be one cent for this so
this is something that you should think

1146
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:04,159
this is something that you should think
 

1147
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,789
this is something that you should think
about as well and then finally one of

1148
00:23:06,789 --> 00:23:06,799
about as well and then finally one of
 

1149
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,549
about as well and then finally one of
the things that you can do with some of

1150
00:23:08,549 --> 00:23:08,559
the things that you can do with some of
 

1151
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:12,190
the things that you can do with some of
the models is that you can do a lot of

1152
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:12,200
the models is that you can do a lot of
 

1153
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,230
the models is that you can do a lot of
these calls in parallel so once we've

1154
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:15,240
these calls in parallel so once we've
 

1155
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,950
these calls in parallel so once we've
got this call done none of these calls

1156
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:17,960
got this call done none of these calls
 

1157
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:21,070
got this call done none of these calls
are actually reliant on each other they

1158
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:21,080
are actually reliant on each other they
 

1159
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,669
are actually reliant on each other they
basically just rely on that first call

1160
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:23,679
basically just rely on that first call
 

1161
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,350
basically just rely on that first call
that we've got there so that allows you

1162
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:25,360
that we've got there so that allows you
 

1163
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,029
that we've got there so that allows you
to do a lot of things in parallel as you

1164
00:23:27,029 --> 00:23:27,039
to do a lot of things in parallel as you
 

1165
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:29,149
to do a lot of things in parallel as you
go through this so you can see here's an

1166
00:23:29,149 --> 00:23:29,159
go through this so you can see here's an
 

1167
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:31,549
go through this so you can see here's an
example of some of the sectioning that

1168
00:23:31,549 --> 00:23:31,559
example of some of the sectioning that
 

1169
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:34,710
example of some of the sectioning that
comes out where I'm getting it returning

1170
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:34,720
comes out where I'm getting it returning
 

1171
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,430
comes out where I'm getting it returning
each section in an XML tag it's got the

1172
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:38,440
each section in an XML tag it's got the
 

1173
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,230
each section in an XML tag it's got the
timestamp in there it's got a whole

1174
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:40,240
timestamp in there it's got a whole
 

1175
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,750
timestamp in there it's got a whole
bunch of things in there as we go

1176
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:41,760
bunch of things in there as we go
 

1177
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,070
bunch of things in there as we go
through this and if you get your prompt

1178
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:44,080
through this and if you get your prompt
 

1179
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,789
through this and if you get your prompt
you should get the sections for the

1180
00:23:46,789 --> 00:23:46,799
you should get the sections for the
 

1181
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:49,510
you should get the sections for the
entire thing as we go through in here

1182
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:49,520
entire thing as we go through in here
 

1183
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,549
entire thing as we go through in here
all right so the advantages of doing

1184
00:23:51,549 --> 00:23:51,559
all right so the advantages of doing
 

1185
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:53,870
all right so the advantages of doing
this is that you can get an llm to focus

1186
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:53,880
this is that you can get an llm to focus
 

1187
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,510
this is that you can get an llm to focus
just on just a section but in the

1188
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:56,520
just on just a section but in the
 

1189
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,789
just on just a section but in the
context of the full document that you've

1190
00:23:58,789 --> 00:23:58,799
context of the full document that you've
 

1191
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,789
context of the full document that you've
got going here this is a big Advantage

1192
00:24:00,789 --> 00:24:00,799
got going here this is a big Advantage
 

1193
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,950
got going here this is a big Advantage
for getting better quality summaries you

1194
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:02,960
for getting better quality summaries you
 

1195
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,310
for getting better quality summaries you
can pass the entire transcript document

1196
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:05,320
can pass the entire transcript document
 

1197
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:08,110
can pass the entire transcript document
article something in you can get longer

1198
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:08,120
article something in you can get longer
 

1199
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:11,230
article something in you can get longer
summaries at end that go Way Beyond

1200
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:11,240
summaries at end that go Way Beyond
 

1201
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,950
summaries at end that go Way Beyond
8,000 tokens or rather longer sets of

1202
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:13,960
8,000 tokens or rather longer sets of
 

1203
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,630
8,000 tokens or rather longer sets of
notes at the end that go Way Beyond the

1204
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:16,640
notes at the end that go Way Beyond the
 

1205
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,990
notes at the end that go Way Beyond the
8,000 tokens what are the disadvantages

1206
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:19,000
8,000 tokens what are the disadvantages
 

1207
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,990
8,000 tokens what are the disadvantages
of this definitely it's using a lot more

1208
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:21,000
of this definitely it's using a lot more
 

1209
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,710
of this definitely it's using a lot more
tokens that's not such a big issue

1210
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:23,720
tokens that's not such a big issue
 

1211
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,310
tokens that's not such a big issue
though when you've got something like

1212
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:25,320
though when you've got something like
 

1213
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:28,750
though when you've got something like
Hau where the tokens are just so cheap

1214
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:28,760
Hau where the tokens are just so cheap
 

1215
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,269
Hau where the tokens are just so cheap
probably the biggest disadvantage is

1216
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:31,279
probably the biggest disadvantage is
 

1217
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,389
probably the biggest disadvantage is
that the more calls that you need are

1218
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:34,399
that the more calls that you need are
 

1219
00:24:34,399 --> 00:24:35,909
that the more calls that you need are
not going to be that the price is not

1220
00:24:35,909 --> 00:24:35,919
not going to be that the price is not
 

1221
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:38,350
not going to be that the price is not
going to be the big thing there but just

1222
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:38,360
going to be the big thing there but just
 

1223
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,389
going to be the big thing there but just
making sure that you've got quota to do

1224
00:24:40,389 --> 00:24:40,399
making sure that you've got quota to do
 

1225
00:24:40,399 --> 00:24:43,190
making sure that you've got quota to do
calls so when I opened up the summary

1226
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:43,200
calls so when I opened up the summary
 

1227
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,789
calls so when I opened up the summary
app for some test users one of the

1228
00:24:45,789 --> 00:24:45,799
app for some test users one of the
 

1229
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:47,389
app for some test users one of the
things was it started crashing because

1230
00:24:47,389 --> 00:24:47,399
things was it started crashing because
 

1231
00:24:47,399 --> 00:24:49,389
things was it started crashing because
it was going beyond the 60 queries per

1232
00:24:49,389 --> 00:24:49,399
it was going beyond the 60 queries per
 

1233
00:24:49,399 --> 00:24:51,669
it was going beyond the 60 queries per
minute that it was allowed to do on that

1234
00:24:51,669 --> 00:24:51,679
minute that it was allowed to do on that
 

1235
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,870
minute that it was allowed to do on that
platform and something like that so you

1236
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:53,880
platform and something like that so you
 

1237
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,310
platform and something like that so you
will need to basically if you're going

1238
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:55,320
will need to basically if you're going
 

1239
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,669
will need to basically if you're going
to put something into production you'll

1240
00:24:56,669 --> 00:24:56,679
to put something into production you'll
 

1241
00:24:56,679 --> 00:24:57,950
to put something into production you'll
need to make sure that you can get

1242
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:57,960
need to make sure that you can get
 

1243
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,909
need to make sure that you can get
access to more quota for this kind of

1244
00:25:00,909 --> 00:25:00,919
access to more quota for this kind of
 

1245
00:25:00,919 --> 00:25:03,070
access to more quota for this kind of
thing in conclusion just to finish up I

1246
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:03,080
thing in conclusion just to finish up I
 

1247
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,549
thing in conclusion just to finish up I
would say that you really should be

not just even on picking the best model

all the time you really want to pick the

all the time you really want to pick the

model that is right for the level of use
 

1261
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,510
model that is right for the level of use
that you're going to use and often

that you're going to use and often
 

1263
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,590
that you're going to use and often
that's going to mean that you're going

1264
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:24,600
that's going to mean that you're going
 

1265
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,110
that's going to mean that you're going
to pick a smaller variant of a

00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:27,120
to pick a smaller variant of a

very fast and very cheap for this now

yes you can run open source models and

1272
00:25:34,389 --> 00:25:34,399
yes you can run open source models and
 

1273
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:36,510
yes you can run open source models and
stuff like that for most people while

00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:36,520
stuff like that for most people while
 

1275
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,430
stuff like that for most people while
there's certainly other cases for that I

1276
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:38,440
there's certainly other cases for that I
 

1277
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,510
there's certainly other cases for that I
would say for most people you're

1278
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:40,520
would say for most people you're
 

1279
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,470
would say for most people you're
actually going to be much better off

1280
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:42,480
actually going to be much better off

00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,350
actually going to be much better off
just going with a service provider that

1282
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:44,360
just going with a service provider that
 

1283
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,510
just going with a service provider that
gives you a sort of fixed price per

1284
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:46,520
gives you a sort of fixed price per
 

1285
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,430
gives you a sort of fixed price per
token for doing this rather than having

00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:48,440
token for doing this rather than having
 

1287
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:51,350
token for doing this rather than having
to pay for GPU time that often perhaps

1288
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:51,360
to pay for GPU time that often perhaps
 

1289
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,389
to pay for GPU time that often perhaps
you don't need or you only need parts it

1290
00:25:53,389 --> 00:25:53,399
you don't need or you only need parts it
 

1291
00:25:53,399 --> 00:25:55,669
you don't need or you only need parts it
that kind of another conclusion I would

1292
00:25:55,669 --> 00:25:55,679
that kind of another conclusion I would
 

1293
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,310
that kind of another conclusion I would
say is don't be afraid to use lots of

1294
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:57,320
say is don't be afraid to use lots of
 

1295
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,710
say is don't be afraid to use lots of
tokens for inputs I see this time and

1296
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:00,720
tokens for inputs I see this time and
 

1297
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,190
tokens for inputs I see this time and
time again that people are constantly

1298
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:02,200
time again that people are constantly
 

1299
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,710
time again that people are constantly
trying to prune their prompts to try and

1300
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:04,720
trying to prune their prompts to try and
 

1301
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,230
trying to prune their prompts to try and
save money and stuff like that usually

1302
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:07,240
save money and stuff like that usually
 

1303
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,830
save money and stuff like that usually
more often than not that actually just

1304
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:08,840
more often than not that actually just
 

1305
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,149
more often than not that actually just
means you end up getting worse results

1306
00:26:11,149 --> 00:26:11,159
means you end up getting worse results
 

1307
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:13,029
means you end up getting worse results
so you're better to go for the cheaper

1308
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:13,039
so you're better to go for the cheaper
 

1309
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:16,389
so you're better to go for the cheaper
model and actually use more tokens than

1310
00:26:16,389 --> 00:26:16,399
model and actually use more tokens than
 

1311
00:26:16,399 --> 00:26:18,950
model and actually use more tokens than
just trying to basically budget your

1312
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:18,960
just trying to basically budget your
 

1313
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,549
just trying to basically budget your
tokens on a really big model use the big

1314
00:26:21,549 --> 00:26:21,559
tokens on a really big model use the big
 

1315
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:23,669
tokens on a really big model use the big
models when the cheap models fail so for

1316
00:26:23,669 --> 00:26:23,679
models when the cheap models fail so for
 

1317
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:25,909
models when the cheap models fail so for
certain things you will need a big model

1318
00:26:25,909 --> 00:26:25,919
certain things you will need a big model
 

1319
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,750
certain things you will need a big model
but the cheaper models things like High

1320
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:28,760
but the cheaper models things like High
 

1321
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,350
but the cheaper models things like High
and and there are others coming from the

big providers and stuff like that these
 

1325
00:26:33,399 --> 00:26:35,750

doing this kind of thing adding to this

various things in and finally then just
 

1347
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,669
various things in and finally then just

think about how you're calling the model
 

1349
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,789
think about how you're calling the model
rather than just one call to do one
